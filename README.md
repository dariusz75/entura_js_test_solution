# Entura js test solution

##Write a function which adds a new ship of a specified length to the board.

###Potential issues:
Task doesn't spcify what is the maximum length of the Battleship so I've assumed it had been validated in the input form.
Also task doesn't spcify if the ship should be placed vertically or horizontally so I created two solutions.

I took me more than half an hour but I can explain, how I  approached and solved the problem.
